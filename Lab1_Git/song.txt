The Neighbourhood - Afraid

[Intro]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place

[Verse 1]
Make that money, fake that bunny, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paid junk honey, your face so sunny, ain't that funny?
All my friends always lie to me, I know they're thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
You're too mean, I don't like you
Fuck you, anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but, I won't fight you
You suck, anyway
You make me want to die, right when I

[Chorus]
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might take my place
When I wake up, I'm afraid
Somebody else might end up being me
(Being me, being me)
